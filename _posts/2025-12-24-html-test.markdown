Write a post about how I made the DMS visualization. Treat like a resume

I created an interactive visualization for the DMS (Data Management System) project to help users better understand and navigate the complex data structures involved. The visualization was built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging libraries such as D3.js for dynamic data representation.
